##Specifications

* Page displays 5 text fields plus a radio selector.
  * The user can input any numbers in the 5 fields and select express or standard shipping speed

  *    cost per pound = $1.50
  *    service charge of $0.50 for each cubic foot beyond 2 cubic feet
  *    1 cubic foot = 12 * 12 * 12 = 1728
  *    distance represented in miles
  *    cost of distance is set at $1 per 1000 miles
